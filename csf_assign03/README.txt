Cache Simulator Report

We will be using cache size total = 32,768 Bytes
Parameters we experimented with:
1. Associativity factor: direct-mapped (1 block/set), fully-associative (1 set of n blocks), 2-way, 4-way
2. Write-back + Write-allocate, write-through + no-write-allocate
3. LRU, FIFO
4. Block Size: 16 bytes, 64 bytes

So in total, we record the total_cycles for all 32 combinations and find the best cache configuration. 
We will test with swim.trace first!

Intermediate Result:
From the experiment above, we can see that test case #9 was the best cache configuration with the lowest total cycles:

fully-associative, Write-back + Write-allocate, LRU, block_size = 16
./csim 1 2048 16 write-allocate write-back lru < swim.trace
Total cycles:8506793


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since it is expensive for us to achieve fully associative and more realistic to to have multiple sets, 
we decided to keep the parameters of this successful configuration, and only change the associativity 
factor (and also the number of blocks in each set to keep a constant cache size). 
We started from "direct mapping" spectrum and moved towards the "fully associative" spectrumï¼š

As we're moving from direct-mapping to fully-associative, we see that the total cycle count is decreasing.
Yet this decreasing process is slowly decreasing, and we get to a diminishing point: 512-way set-associative cache
After this "diminishing point", we're seeing significantly less "returns". In fact, the total cycle has increases from
8506393 to 8506793 after this. Thus this is the sweet point where we still have good performance, while not straining the 
hardware to achieve a fully associative cache.

FINAL BEST CONFIG:
512-way, write-allocate + write-back, LRU, block size = 16bytes
./csim 4 512 16 write-allocate write-back lru < swim.trace
Total cycles:8506393

As we can see, we have the same results for gcc.trace:
test #9 had the lowest total cycle count as well

fully-associative, Write-back + Write-allocate, LRU, block_size = 16
./csim 1 2048 16 write-allocate write-back lru < gcc.trace
Total cycles:8538483

Modifying this configuration to have a 512 sets:

512-way, write-allocate + write-back, LRU, block size = 16bytes
./csim 4 512 16 write-allocate write-back lru < gcc.trace
Total cycles:8547283

Gives us a really good total cycle count again, which is just slightly higher than its fully-associative counterpart,
but at much more efficiency.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION:

By experimenting with all 32 combinations for both swim.trace and gcc.trace, we found the best configuration, 
which was a fully-associative cache. To promote efficiency, we were able to modify the associativity factor to
strike a balance between performance and efficiency.

Our final configuration is 
512-way, write-allocate + write-back, LRU, block size = 16bytes
